The development sources are available through anonymous git at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=cockroach

Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

Building
--------
After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./bootstrap
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
